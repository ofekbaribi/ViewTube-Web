### Working Process
Our development process was a collaborative effort, with each team member assigned specific missions. Here’s a breakdown of how we approached the project:

Task Assignment: Each team member was assigned distinct pages to create, focusing on both design and implementation of the required logic. This ensured that everyone had a clear role and responsibility.

Design Implementation: We began by implementing the original design for each assigned page, ensuring that the user interface was both intuitive and visually appealing.

Building Logical Infrastructure: Concurrently, we developed the necessary logical infrastructure. This involved creating the contexts needed for state management and gathering the required data for each component.

Coordination and Integration: Throughout the development process, team members coordinated with each other to ensure compatibility and cohesion. Once individual components and pages were completed, we integrated them into a seamless, functioning website.

Testing and Refinement: After combining all the files and components, we conducted thorough testing to ensure the website worked smoothly and met all requirements. We fixed any bugs and made necessary refinements.

Android App Development: Following the completion of the website, we began developing an Android app for the project. This involved adapting the website’s features and logic for a mobile environment, ensuring a consistent user experience across platforms.

By dividing tasks effectively, maintaining clear communication, and integrating our work cohesively, we successfully developed both a fully functioning website and a complementary Android application.
